# Drowsiness-Detection
Python and CNN based mini project to detect user drowsiness



The software takes feed from the webcam and tracks eyes and mouth to check for drowsiness.

Open or Closed eye was detected using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model and yawning mouth was detected using M.A.R.
